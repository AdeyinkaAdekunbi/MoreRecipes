MoreRecipes provides a platform for users to share the awesome and exciting recipe ideas they have invented or learnt. Suppose a user comes up with a recipe, he/she can post it on More-Recipes and get feedback in form of reviews and votes from other users who explore that recipe. Users can also keep a list of their favorite recipes on the application.
